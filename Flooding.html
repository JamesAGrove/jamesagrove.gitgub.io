							<p>Globally, about 40% of all classified national disasters are due to flooding (The Geological Society, 2016). In the UK at least one in six people are at risk of some form of flooding (Environment Agency, 2022). There are multiple sources of flooding, including: fluvial/river; coastal; surface water; and ground water. Whilst flooding gains wide traction due to the loss of assets, properties and life, the frequency and severity of flooding incidents is likely to increase in the UK alongside rising surface temperatures caused by anthropogenic climate change (Dale, 2005).  </p>
							<p>Flood risk management is targeted at the catchment scale (Environment Agency, 2022), meaning plans for different river basins differ to respond to the variation caused by geology present in a region. For example the Humber basin has a wide variety of  geological structures, from coal measures to the West to Chalk to the East (see figure below). As an area’s river’s response to rainfall differs based on it’s geological characteristics measures to mitigate impacts also differs regionally (Environment Agency, 2022). </p>

							<h1>Flood Forecasting</h1>
							<p>Flood forecasting in England is undertaken by the collaboration between Met Office and Environment Agency. Forecasts are based off rainfall, observed river levels (telemetry) and historical data of river response to rainfall. Models also factor the influence of climate change but issues have arisen as the resolution of climate change modelling is not the same spatial scale as modelling of river response (Dale, 2005). Also, flood models must take into account topography, channel size and flood defence structures to forecast the likely impacts of certain rainfall amounts (Slater et al., 2021). </p>
